## About
This project was developed as part of the coursework for an engineering class at the University of Florida, Gainesville. 

This repository provides a framework for analyzing jet engine performance. The current scope of this project is to calculate the performance conditions of a turbofan engine at any stage within the engine. Different stages also are designed to communicate in order to resolve the desired parameter at any point in the engine cycle.
